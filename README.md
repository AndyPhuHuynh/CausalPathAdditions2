# CausalPath
This is a tool for pathway analysis of proteomics and phosphoproteomics datasets. CausalPath aims to identify mechanistic pathway relations that can explain observed correlations in experiments, as examplified below.

Please visit our [web-service](http://104.198.75.85:3001/) that runs an instance of CausalPath.

Alternatively, users can locally run this Java code on their datasets, and visualize the results in [ChiBE](https://github.com/PathwayCommons/chibe). To get a copy of the project and build it, first make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [JDK8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) in your system, then while in your projects folder, do:
```
git pull https://github.com/PathwayAndDataAnalysis/causalpath.git
cd causalpath
mvn clean install
mvn assembly:single
```
The last command should create `causalpath.jar` under `causalpath/target` directory. Then you can run the code by
```
java -jar target/causalpath.jar path/to/input/directory
```
The input directory has to contain a `parameters.txt` file which provides the necessary parameters and links to the input data files. Please refer to [this page](todo) for preparation of inputs.

After CausalPath runs on your input data, it generates output in the same input directory where the `parameters.txt` is. Among those output files, `causal.sif` and `causal.format` are two files that ChiBE needs for displaying the result graph. To display, please open ChiBE and from the menu, do `SIF -> Load SIF File`. Navigate to the directory and select `causal.sif`. 

A manuscript for this method is currently under preparation.
